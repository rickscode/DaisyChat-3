Where Coinbase shines Where Coinbase falls short What Coinbase is best for Coinbase at a glance Full details about Coinbase Is Coinbase right for you? How we review cryptocurrency platforms: our methodology Trading platforms. Coinbase users can trade on several platforms. The original Coinbase platform is a relatively simple interface that allows users to use U.S. dollars to purchase cryptocurrency. Coinbase Advanced Trade has advanced charting functions and allows users to make crypto-to-crypto transactions and place market, limit and stop orders. Coinbase has also rolled out a newer option, called Coinbase One, which offers no-fee trades and other benefits in exchange for a monthly fee of about $30. Learn to earn. A novel way to “earn while you learn,” Coinbase provides a series of video classes and exams as a way to educate users about cryptocurrency trading and some of the cryptocurrencies on offer. And, by taking the classes, users can earn a few dollars worth of certain cryptocurrencies. Quick withdrawals. Coinbase is one of the few crypto exchanges to allow users to withdraw crypto immediately after they purchase it using fiat currency, rather than waiting several days for the payment transaction to clear. This can be a big help for users who want to use cryptocurrency in decentralized apps and other external services. Legal woes. As the largest U.S.-based crypto exchange, Coinbase has been — and will likely continue to be — a focus of regulatory efforts to rein in the industry. In June 2023, Coinbase was hit with a sprawling complaint by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused it of dealing in unregistered securities. The case has implications for the entire U.S. industry, in part because it also names several popular cryptocurrencies as securities. Fees. Coinbase has a lot of ways you can pay for crypto, and they can carry different fees that are at times hard to understand. While Coinbase discloses fees to users before completing a transaction, they are difficult to look up ahead of time. This can make life difficult for people who are choosing an exchange for the first time and who are sensitive to fees. And overall, some competitors do charge less. Cryptocurrency traders looking for convenience. Traders who want to easily convert one cryptocurrency to another. Minimum trade $2. Trading and transaction fees Varies depending on payment method, cryptocurrency type, transaction size and platform. $2.99 for $200 Bitcoin purchase, or about 1.5%. Number of cryptocurrencies More than 250 Crypto-to-crypto trading pairs More than 500. Website transparency Important information, including investment minimums, supported assets and how to close the account, can be easily found on the website. Storage offering Customers can use their own crypto wallets, and Coinbase has some insurance against cybercrime. Staking offering Rewards on a handful of coins, with rates up to about 6% Mobile app Coinbase's highly rated apps have options suited to both beginners and advanced users. Customer service Phone, email and chat. The minimum amount needed to buy cryptocurrency on Coinbase is $2. Coinbase's fee structure is a confusing combination of elements that depend on three factors: Coinbase charges a spread on cryptocurrency sales and purchases. While rates can vary depending on market fluctuations, the company has previously said the fee is about 0.5%. (This fee doesn't apply for orders placed with Advanced Trade.) Coinbase also says it charges fees based on factors “including the selected payment method, the size of the order, and market conditions such as volatility and liquidity.” In addition, Coinbase charges fees to cover the costs of executing transactions on the external blockchain networks that support the cryptocurrencies in which it deals. Overall, these factors can make Coinbase fees difficult to predict on its main platform. The company says it clearly lays out fees for customers before finalizing a transaction. As an example, to buy $200 worth of Bitcoin with USD via ACH, the fee would be about 1.5%. However, if you bought the same amount of Bitcoin with a debit card, that fee rises to 3.99%. By comparison, Coinbase Advanced Trade’s pricing model is more straightforward, though fees have risen slightly in recent years. It's based on your monthly trading volume and liquidity of the asset at the time of purchase; if immediately available, you're charged a “taker” fee, and if your order needs to wait for a buyer, you are charged a “maker” fee. Pricing tier Taker fee Maker fee Up to $10K 0.60% 0.40% $10K - $50K 0.40% 0.25% $50K - $100K 0.25% 0.15% $100K - $1M 0.20% 0.10% $1M - $15M 0.18% 0.08% $15M - $75M 0.16% 0.06% $75M - $250M 0.12% 0.03% $250M - $400M 0.08% 0.00% $400M+ 0.05% 0.00% Coinbase offers more than 250 cryptocurrencies for U.S. customers to trade, a larger number than many other platforms. Coinbase offers more than 500 crypto-to-crypto trading pairs. While cryptocurrency exchanges are not protected by the FDIC or the SIPC, Coinbase says it "Please write an article titled coinbase reveiw use the following text for inspiration: carries crime insurance that protects a portion of digital assets held across our storage systems against losses from theft, including cybersecurity breaches." The company notes the insurance covers only losses related to Coinbase cybersecurity or employee theft; breaches to individual Coinbase accounts (say, if your password were compromised) are not covered. The company also has noted in regulatory filings that its insurance coverage limits are below the total value of cryptocurrency it holds for customers (and it does not say how much insurance it carries). Coinbase also has had to deal with some customer concerns after it said there was a chance that the crypto assets it holds for customers could be subject to bankruptcy proceedings if the company were to have severe financial trouble. Coinbase said that no such situation is imminent, however, and in June of 2022 clarified its user policies to say that retail customers' assets were subject to the same protections institutional investors would have in bankruptcy. Holding cash on Coinbase is different, as balances are held in U.S. custodial accounts, money market funds or U.S. Treasurys. If your funds are held in U.S. banks, they are insured up to $250,000 per individual by the FDIC. Coinbase does allow customers to keep digital assets in their own custody, however. One option the company offers is its own Coinbase Wallet, which is set up to help users easily move money off of their exchange and out of the possession of the company. Potential APY on staked coins tops out at around 6% on Coinbase, and there are seven coins that can earn rewards. Coinbase's staking program was part of the SEC's complaint against the company, so the legal questions over staking on the platform will likely linger as the case moves forward. Coinbase says it disputes the SEC's interpretation of the legality of its offerings. Chief executive Brian Armstrong said in a written statement in June that the company is "proud to represent the industry in court to finally get some clarity around crypto rules." The Coinbase apps for iOS and Android are highly rated by users and include many of the same functions and features as the desktop site. The site has advanced tools for more seasoned traders, but also an interface that provides a range of features for users with a variety of experiences. For beginners, there are simple tools for buying and selling; for more advanced crypto investors, there are options for comparing, tracking and trading digital assets. Coinbase has recently added 24/7 live phone support. It also allows customers to reach out by email or chat. The platform also has a strong library of educational content, and Coinbase Earn is a creative way to incentivize users to understand what they’re doing. Coinbase is considered one of the top cryptocurrency exchanges in the U.S. The interface for Coinbase basic service is quick and user-friendly, but it also has a handful of features that might appeal to more seasoned users. That said, the costs of using Coinbase can be difficult to track, especially if you are purchasing cryptocurrency with cash. NerdWallet’s comprehensive review process evaluates and ranks platforms and companies that allow U.S. customers to buy and/or sell cryptocurrency.

Reviewed By Reviewed By Updated: Nov 15, 2022, 2:28pm Coinbase is one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world. It offers trading solutions for beginner, advanced and institutional traders alike. Take a look at what makes it an excellent option for individual traders looking to trade in cryptocurrencies and beyond. Coinbase offers good options for both beginner and advanced traders. The Coinbase platform is a good place for traders with experience to land. With an account minimum of only $2, it’s easy to get started as a Coinbase user, making it a good place to start for beginners. Coinbase encourages beginning crypto traders to learn more about their investments with the platform’s “earn while you learn” program. A series of video classes and exams allows beginners to learn more about various cryptocurrencies while earning rewards. The exchange offers crypto staking. Staking is when a cryptocurrency is locked up on an exchange—usually for proof-of-stake validation—that allows the crypto owner to earn a yield. One of Coinbase’s best features is its customer support. In addition to an online help center and chat system, Coinbase also offers live phone support, a feature conspicuously absent from many cryptocurrency exchanges. As far as storage goes, there are numerous options for users to stash the keys to their crypto. In fact, Coinbase offers users three different crypto wallets. The Coinbase Wallet is the exchange’s hot wallet product, and it claims to support “hundreds of thousands” of crypto assets. The other two wallets are the Coinbase dApp Wallet as well as storage available via Coinbase Exchange itself, which is the exchange’s “default wallet.” The biggest drawback is that the fee structure for Coinbase’s basic version is relatively complex. Fees aren’t published in advance, as they are are “spread fees.” That means they are calculated at the time you place your order, and may be determined by a combination of factors, such as location, payment method, order size and market conditions. A downside for more advanced users is that although Coinbase offers staking on its platform, it charges a 25% commission on yields. That’s a sizable cut compared with other leading crypto exchanges. Coinbase is one of the mainstays in the crypto landscape. The company went public in April 2021, and since then has maintained its spot in the public eye. Coinbase has an easy-to-use platform, but a complicated fee structure. The basic Coinbase platform has an extremely convoluted fee structure. You don’t pay maker/taker fees or a flat fee, but a spread fee that temporarily locks in the price for the transaction. You don’t get to see the fee you’ll pay until you’re about to submit the trade. Coinbases spread fees typically run around 0.5%. For Coinbase’s Advanced Trade users, the company charges a much simpler maker/taker fee on all transactions. Maker/taker fees are common on most crypto exchanges. A maker creates liquidity on a platform, while a taker decreases it. The only drawback for users is that they don’t know whether they are a maker or a taker until after a transaction. As with most crypto exchanges, Advanced Trade’s maker/taker fees decrease as the user trades higher volumes of currency. View the full range of fees for Coinbase Advanced Trade in the table below: In addition to trading fees for cryptocurrencies, Advanced Trade also charges a 0.001% taker fee on select stablecoin pairs, such as USD Coin (USDC)/EUR and Tether (USDT) and USD. Coinbase’s security protocols include checking the dark web for customer passwords, recommending the use of a third-party security key and offering onsite security prompts. All U.S. dollar deposits on the Coinbase site are held in FDIC-insured bank accounts. Crypto holdings are not covered. Coinbase carries criminal insurance, which covers security breaches to the site but not compromised login credentials. For this reason, it’s important that customers adhere to Coinbase’s strongest security recommendations. Coinbase was subject to a series of hacks between March 2021 and May 2021. During this period, more than 6,000 customers had their accounts drained. To open a Coinbase account, you need to be at least 18 or older, have a government-issued ID, an internet connection and a phone number. Coinbase, like most crypto exchanges, doesn’t charge any fees for opening an account. Once a user taps the “get started” button on the Coinbase homepage, they’ll enter their legal name, email and password. They also need to prove their location. A verification email will then be sent to the user. After verifying their email, the user also has to verify their phone number for two-factor authentication. The final steps in setting up a Coinbase account include answering a few questions concerning employment and source of funds and verifying the user’s identity using photographs of an ID. Once all this is completed, the user can link to a payment method and begin funding their account. Crypto wallets come in many shapes and varieties. For that reason, Coinbase offers more than a one-size fits-all wallet for your crypto storage needs. The exchange actually offers three different types of hot/online wallets: Coinbase offers more than 200 cryptocurrencies and stablecoins for trading. Here is a list of some of the most popular cryptos available for trading on Coinbase: A full list of Coinbase coin offerings can be found here. Coinbase’s basic platform has an extremely complex fee structure for beginners. With fees based on a mix of trader location, payment method, order size and market conditions, it’s difficult for users on the barebones platform to calculate what they might pay before they trade. Beginning users could benefit from something as clear-cut as the Advanced Trade platform for their trades. Coinbase offers cryptocurrency staking. However, customers who stake their coins on Coinbase will lose 25% of their yield profits in fees back to the exchange, a hefty price to pay. 1 Coinbase 0.4% Maker Fee / 0.6% Taker Fee 200+ 1 Coinbase On Coinbase's Secure Website 2 eToro Join eToro and get $10 of free Crypto!

To rank the best crypto exchanges overall and the best exchanges for beginners, we assessed all of the features and options offered by these 25 platforms. The editorial team then developed a standardized methodology, analyzing 10 key benchmark features and variables to assess quality across the platforms. Basic trading features count as one factor in the overall and beginner rankings. Other ranking factors include platform availability, customer service, educational resources, security and storage, staking and rewards, to name a few. The sum of weighted values across all or some of these key factors was calculated for each ranking to award each brokerage or exchange its overall rank. Margin trading, platform lending, and advanced trading were not considered for choosing the best crypto exchanges for beginners. Find Out If Coinbase Is Right For You On Coinbase's Secure Website Coinbase’s Advanced Trade platform is the updated version of Coinbase’s Pro platform. Coinbase migrated the features from their Pro website (as well as some additional features) to the basic site and renamed this more advanced version of the service: Advanced Trade. Coinbase offers a handful of rewards programs for its users. You can earn rewards on Coinbase either by staking your crypto for up to 5.75% annual percentage yield (APY). The exchange also offers “the earn while you learn” program. Coinbase offers a rewards debit card. The Coinbase Card is a Visa debit card that gives users crypto rewards on certain purchases. As an added perk, there are no spending fees and no annual fees. Coinbase provides a platform for trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs). With Coinbase, users can follow trending collections or keep up with featured creators. All of the NFTs available on Coinbase can be purchased with either Ethereum or U.S. dollars. Coinbase allows for derivatives trading. As far as derivatives go, Coinbase deals primarily in futures. Futures trading is allowed on the platform in five asset classes: Ethereum, Bitcoin, the Bloomberg U.S. Large Cap Index, crude oil and SuperTech, an index of 15 U.S. tech giants.
